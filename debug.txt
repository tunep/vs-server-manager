feat(rpc): Migrate RPC implementation to OpenRPC

This commit migrates the RPC implementation from the `json-rpc` library to the `openrpc` library. This change was requested to align with OpenRPC specifications.

Key changes include:

- **Dependency Update:**
    - Removed `json-rpc` from `pyproject.toml`.
    - Added `openrpc` to `pyproject.toml`.

- **`vsm/rpc.py` Refactoring:**
    - `SchedulerRPCServer` was rewritten to utilize `openrpc.RPCServer`. It now exposes scheduler methods (`get_status`, `get_jobs`) by registering wrapper functions with the `openrpc` server instance.
    - `SchedulerRPCClient` remains a custom JSON-RPC 2.0 client due to the raw socket transport, as the `openrpc.client.RPCClient` is designed for HTTP/WebSocket endpoints. It continues to send standard JSON-RPC 2.0 requests and parses the `openrpc` server's responses.

- **Compatibility:**
    - The `vsm/daemon.py` and `vsm/background.py` scripts were adapted to correctly instantiate and use the new `openrpc`-based `SchedulerRPCServer`.
    - The `vsm/tui/tabs/scheduler_tab.py` remains compatible as it interacts with the `SchedulerRPCClient`'s updated interface.
