## Summary

This PR introduces a complete Textual-based TUI for managing Vintage Story dedicated servers, replacing the original CLI approach.

### Key Features
- **Tab-based interface** with Status, Logs, Backups, Scheduler, and Console tabs
- **Server control** with Start/Stop/Restart buttons and transitional state display (Starting/Stopping/Restarting)
- **Live log viewer** with file selection and automatic filtering of status block noise
- **Backup management** with server state validation - blocks backups during transitional states, shows confirmation dialog when server is running
- **Editable configuration** - both VSM config and serverconfig.json can be edited via modal dialogs
- **Scheduled backups** with APScheduler integration and player announcements
- **Arrow key navigation** for control buttons in Status tab

### Technical Highlights
- Uses `run_blocking()` worker pattern to run blocking subprocess calls without freezing the UI
- StatusTab tracks transitional states (`_starting`, `_stopping`, `_restarting`) for accurate UI feedback
- BackupsTab coordinates with StatusTab to prevent backups during server state transitions
- Modal screens for config editing with type preservation (int, float, bool, null)
- Log filtering removes verbose status blocks from server-main.log output

## Test plan
- [ ] Launch TUI with `vsm` command
- [ ] Verify server status displays correctly (Running/Stopped/Starting/Stopping)
- [ ] Test Start/Stop/Restart buttons show appropriate transitional states
- [ ] Verify logs tab loads files and filters status noise
- [ ] Test world backup (requires running server)
- [ ] Test server backup with confirmation dialog when server is running
- [ ] Verify backups are blocked during Starting/Stopping states
- [ ] Test config editing (press `c` or Config button)
- [ ] Test server config editing from Status tab
- [ ] Verify scheduler tab displays jobs correctly
